1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client The Gaming Room wanted a web based version of their game app Draw It or Lose It, that is currently only available on Android. They would like for it to only allow for one version of the game to be running that allows so many players in. When the game ends then those players are removed and the next players are put into the game.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think that explained my decisions well and also the topics in the document such as the OS descriptions and the clients wishes.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working on the design document helped because it let me think about the project more and how to deal with different parts of the code.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

It would be explaining the System Architecture View and the Domain Model earlier in the document.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted their needs by designing the code so that there is only one version of the game running. I also made it so that users have different roles tied to their accounts so that admins can be in games as well. Considering the users needs is important because it gives you a clear direction to design the code towards, and it will create a program that users and your client are happy with.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached disigning software by first clearly understanding what needs to be done for rhe program, then plan out the order to complete the items and from their work on it.
